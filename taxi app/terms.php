<h2>Terms &amp; Conditions of GoogleCardboard</h2>

<p>Before you use our app, we need to set out our terms and conditions of use. By using the app you acknowledge and agree that these terms and conditions are the rules of access and use of our app. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please cease use of the app.
</p>


<strong>1 Parties</strong>
<p>This is an agreement between you, a person or entity trying to make a payment (Payer), or you, a person or entity trying to receive payment (Payee) and Alexander Butterworth ABN 75 797 367 505 trading as MoneyCat (Facilitator).<br>
By using the app known as MoneyCat (App) or creating an account on the App, the Payer or Payee (User) agrees to these terms and conditions. The App is only available to legal entities and persons who are at least eighteen years old and are capable of forming legally binding contracts.<br>
The User acknowledges and agrees that by using the App, the User is agreeing to be bound by these terms and conditions. If the User does not accept these terms and conditions in their entirety, the User may not access or use the App.<br>
If the User agrees to these terms and conditions on behalf of an entity, the User represents and warrants that the User has the authority to bind that entity to these terms and conditions. In that event, the words "User", "Payer": or "Payee" will refer to and apply to that entity.</p>


<strong>2 Services</strong>
<p>The App allows Payees to send requests for payment to Payers, and allows Payers to make payment to Payees (Services). Under these terms and conditions, the Facilitator provides the Services to Users (which is the term used to describe both Payers and Payees). <br>
The Services only include facilitating payment between the Payers and Payees. The Facilitator does not provide services to the User other than facilitating payment between the two parties.
</p>

<strong>3 Scope of the Services</strong>
<p>From time to time the App will generate automated emails to Users, or Users will send emails and messages to one another through the App. Emails and messages sent by the App or through the App are considered a part of the Services and are covered by these terms and conditions.<br>
The Services do not include facilitating the formation of contracts between Payers and Payees (Contracts), nor do the Services include managing disputes related to those Contracts. Subject to clause Error: Reference source not found, if a Payer and a Payee agree on terms, a Contract is formed directly between the Payer and Payee and does not involved the Facilitator. <br>
The Facilitator collects payment from Payers following their agreement to a request from the Payee. A fee will be added to the amount paid by the Payer under clause 4. Payees will receive payment directly from the Payer and the fee will be paid to the Facilitator.
</p>

<strong>4 Fees</strong>
<p>If a Payer or Payee accesses the App to view the App's functionality, no fees are payable. Fees will become payable under this clause 4 when a request is sent from a Payee to a Payer using the App, and the Payer agrees to make payment to the Payee.<br>
The Facilitator will charge a fee to Payers using the App and making payments to Payees. These fees include a flat fee of AUD$0.50 (50 cents) added to payments made to the Payee from Payers. These fees do not include any third party credit card fees or PayPal or other fees that may be charged by a party's bank. Where payments are made using a payment method other than PayPal, a fee of 3% may be charged to the Payer to cover credit card processing fees.<br>
Where a Payer agrees to pay a Payee, payment will be automatically added to the amount deducted from the Payer's credit card, PayPal account or other payment system provided to the Facilitator.
</p>

<strong>5 GST</strong>
<p>In clause 5, a word or expression defined in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) has the meaning given to it in that Act.<br>
Any consideration to be paid or provided for a supply made under or in connection with these terms and conditions, unless specifically described as GST inclusive, does not include an amount on account of GST.<br>
If a party makes a supply under or in connection with these terms and conditions in respect of which GST is payable, the consideration for the supply but for the application of this clause 5 (GST exclusive consideration) is increased by an amount equal to the GST exclusive consideration multiplied by the rate of GST prevailing at the time the supply is made.<br>
The recipient of a supply made under or in connection with these terms and conditions must pay the amount by which the GST exclusive consideration is increased:
(a) at the same time as the GST exclusive consideration is payable or to be provided; and
(b) without set off, deduction or requirement for demand.
If a payment to a party under these terms and conditions is a reimbursement or indemnification, calculated by reference to a loss, cost or expense incurred by that party, then the payment is reduced by the amount of any input tax credit to which that party is entitled for that loss, cost or expense.<br>
A party need not make a payment for a taxable supply made under or in connection with these terms and conditions until it receives a tax invoice for the supply to which the payment relates.
</p>
